## API TRIP TIES
TRIP-TIES: Social Network focused on travelers ðŸš—âœˆðŸš¢ 

This database was developed with NodeJS v-18.13. The diagram was created using dbdiagram, then in VSC we started using Express and MongoDB with mongoose to call the database. We also used libraries like bcrypt for password encryption, nodemailer for email sending, multer for file management. The authentication was done with passport JWT. Best practices were also handled with eslint. A challenge for the backend team since it was our first opportunity to work with non-relational databases. We had the opportunity to learn more in depth and thanks to bugs, understand the code better.
